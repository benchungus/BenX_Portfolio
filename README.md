Portfolio for Human Language Technologies

NLP is a subfield of AI that deals with how computers interact with the human language. As AI becomes more and more prevalent within our society, the importance of understanding how it works and what it can do increases daily. In that sense, learning about NLP is something that has interested me for a while. In this class, I learned about various NLP techniques used by AI and even developed my own models and AI. This area of study is very interesting to me because I can count on it to improve rapidly, creating more and more for me to learn. I've always thought that NLP was extremely complex and out of reach, but after learning how it really works and getting familiar with some tools used to simplify the process, I realized that this was something that even I could incorporate in my own projects. One thing that was very interesting to me would be the text classification assignments, because you could use it to train a computer to make accurate predictions based on the text it was given. It would be cool to try to use that in future projects. Future job opportunities that involve NLP would interest me greatly, as I imagine it would be exciting not only learning new technologies, but also knowing that I am developing and pushing the boundaries of something on the cutting edge.
